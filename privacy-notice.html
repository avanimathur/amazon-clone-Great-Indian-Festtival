For instance, we collect from sellers information regarding place of establishment and bank account information for identity verification and other purposes.</li>
                    <li><strong>Communicate with you.</strong> We use your personal information to communicate with you in relation to Amazon Services via different channels (e.g., by phone, e-mail, chat).</li>
                    <li><strong>Advertising.</strong> We use your personal information to display interest-based ads for features, products, and services that might be of interest to you.

                <h2>Does Amazon Share Your Personal Information?</h2>
                <p>Information about our customers is an important part of our business and we are not in the business of selling our customers’ personal information to others. We share customers’ personal information only as described below and with Amazon.com, Inc. and subsidiaries that Amazon.com, Inc. controls that either are subject to this Privacy Notice or follow practices at least as protective as those described in this Privacy Notice.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Transactions involving Third Parties:</strong> We make available to you services, products, applications, or skills provided by third parties for use on or through Amazon Services. For example, the products you order through our marketplace are from third parties, you can download applications from third-party application providers from our App Store, and enable third-party skills through our Alexa services. We also offer services or sell product lines jointly with third-party businesses, such as sellers on the marketplace, restaurants registered on Amazon.in, merchants providing mobile recharges and bill-payment assistance. You can tell when a third party is involved in your transactions, and we share customers’ personal information related to those transactions with that third party.</li>
                    <li><strong>Third-Party Service Providers:</strong> We employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples include fulfilling orders for products or services, delivering packages, sending postal mail and e-mail, removing repetitive information from customer lists, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, providing search results and links (including paid listings and links), processing payments, transmitting content, scoring, assessing and managing credit risk, and providing customer service. These third-party service providers have access to personal information needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes. Further, they must process the personal information in accordance with applicable law.</li>
                    <li><strong>Business Transfers:</strong> As we continue to develop our business, we might sell or buy other businesses or services. In such transactions, customer information generally is one of the transferred business assets but remains subject to the promises made in any pre-existing Privacy Notice (unless, of course, the customer consents otherwise). Also, in the unlikely event that Amazon.com, Inc. or Amazon Seller Services Private Limited or any of its affiliates, or substantially all of their assets are acquired, customer information will of course be one of the transferred assets.</li>
                    <li><strong>Protection of Amazon and Others:</strong> We release account and other personal information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law; enforce or apply our Conditions of Use and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of Amazon, our users, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Other than as set out above, you will receive notice when personal information about you might be shared with third parties, and you will have an opportunity to choose not to share the information.</p>

                <p>We design our systems with your security and privacy in mind.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>We work to protect the security of your personal information during transmission by using encryption protocols and software.</li>
                    <li>We follow the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) when handling payment card data.</li>
                    <li>We maintain physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards in connection with the collection, storage, processing, and disclosure of personal customer information. Our security procedures mean that we may occasionally request proof of identity before we disclose personal information to you.</li>
                    <li>Our devices offer security features to protect them against unauthorized access and loss of data. You can control these features and configure them based on your needs. Click here for more information on how to manage the security settings of your device.</li>

                <h2>What About Advertising?</h2>
                <p><strong>Third-Party Advertisers and Links to Other Websites:</strong> Amazon Services may include third-party advertising and links to other websites and apps. Third-party advertising partners may collect information about you when you interact with their content, advertising, and services. For more information about third-party advertising at Amazon, including interest-based ads, please read our Interest-Based Ads policy. To adjust your advertising preferences, please go to the Advertising Preferences page.</p>
                <p><strong>Use of Third-Party Advertising Services:</strong> We provide ad companies with information that allows them to serve you with more useful and relevant Amazon ads and to measure their effectiveness. We never share your name or other information that directly identifies you when we do this. Instead, we use an advertising identifier like a cookie, a device identifier, or a code derived from applying irreversible cryptography to other information like an email address. For example, if you have already downloaded one of our apps, we will share your advertising identifier and data about that event so that you will not be served an ad to download the app again. Some ad companies also use this information to serve you relevant ads from other advertisers. You can learn more about how to opt-out of interest-based advertising by going to the Advertising Preferences page.</p>

                <h2>What Choices Do I Have?</h2>
                <p>If you have any questions as to how we collect and use your personal information, please contact our Grievance Officer. Many of our Amazon Services also include settings that provide you with options as to how your information is being used.</p>
                <p>As described above, you can always choose not to provide certain information, but then you might not be able to take advantage of many of the Amazon Services.</p>
                <p>You can add or update certain information on pages such as those referenced in What Information Can I Access?. When you update information, we usually keep a copy of the prior version for our records.</p>
                <p>If you do not want to receive e-mail or other communications from us, please adjust your Customer Communication Preferences. If you don’t want to receive in-app notifications from us, please adjust your notification settings in the app or device.</p>
                <p>If you do not want to see interest-based ads, please adjust your Advertising Preferences.</p>
                <p>The Help feature on most browsers and devices will tell you how to prevent your browser or device from accepting new cookies or other identifiers, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie or how to block cookies altogether. Because cookies and identifiers allow you to take advantage of some essential features of Amazon Services, we recommend that you leave them turned on. For instance, if you block or otherwise reject our cookies, you will not be able to add items to your Shopping Cart, proceed to Checkout, or use any Services that require you to Sign in. For more information about cookies and other identifiers, see our Cookies Notice.</p>
                <p>If you want to browse our websites without linking the browsing history to your account, you may do so by logging out of your account here and blocking cookies on your browser.</p>
                <p>You will also be able to opt out of certain other types of data usage by updating your settings on the applicable Amazon website (e.g., in "Manage Your Content and Devices"), device, or application. For more information click here. Most non-Amazon devices also provide users with the ability to change device permissions (e.g., disable/access location services, contacts). For most devices, these controls are located in the device's settings menu. If you have questions about how to change your device permissions on devices manufactured by third parties, we recommend you contact your mobile service carrier or your device manufacturer.</p>
                <p>If you are a seller, you can add or update certain information in Seller Central, update your account information by accessing your Seller Account Information, and adjust your e-mail or other communications you receive from us by updating your Notification Preferences.</p>
